# 🏎️ F1 RaceIntel: Machine Learning–Powered Race Strategy Optimization

An end-to-end F1 analytics engine that predicts race outcomes, simulates strategy, and visualizes driver performance.

🚀 Overview

F1 RaceIntel is an advanced machine learning system designed to analyze Formula 1 race data and generate actionable race-strategy intelligence.
The project leverages lap-time telemetry, pit-stop metrics, driver performance patterns, and ML predictions to estimate finishing positions and identify the most optimal racing strategy.

This project demonstrates strong competence in:

✔ Feature engineering

✔ ML modeling (XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression)

✔ Data analysis & visualization

✔ Simulation systems

✔ Clean, modular software design

✔ Reproducible, industry-grade project architecture

This level of work aligns with expectations of Microsoft Student Programs, Data & Applied Science Internships, and Machine Learning roles.

🎯 Project Goals

Predict driver finishing positions using ML models

Quantify the effect of pit-stop strategies (0-stop, 1-stop, 2-stop)

Simulate a full race replay based on predicted positions

Create interactive and visual analytics for driver performance

Build a reusable and extendable race-strategy framework
